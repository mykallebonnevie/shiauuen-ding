<p>My performance of Liszt It Is by <a href="http://michaelippolito.com/">Michael Ippolito</a> on March 26 went very well, and I'm looking forward to playing it again with other works in my Dante project at CAM on May 26. It's kind of hard to stay indoors and practice though because it's been gorgeous outside. Spring is here!</p>

<p>Dear friends, so glad to see many of you at <a href="http://icmc2009.org/">ICMC</a> (International Computer Music Conference) in Montreal! It was a good time! For those of you whom I missed, at ICMC this year I presented a poster - <cite>Rhythmic Practice in Music for Small Ensemble and Tape</cite> - and controlled the computer patches for Doug Geers's piece in concert, Tremor Transducer, commissioned by NeXT Ens, my old ensemble, in 2004.</p>

<p>Now I'm back in New York, preparing for the performance of music by Rob Voisey, David Morneau and Brent Chancellor at Composer's Voice Concert on August 30, 1pm, at Jan Hus Sanctuary (351 E 74th St, near 1st Ave). Come and enjoy this concert! It's free!</p>

<p>Dear friends, attending Yiddish Summer Weimar was a precious
experience! There gathered the best East European folk
musicians/teachers beyond belief. I learned lots of lautari and klezmer
tunes and some accordion technique. Now I'm back in New York to practice
on my own. If you see <a href="http://michaelippolito.com/">Michael
Ippolito</a> and me playing an accordion duo in Central Park, please
stop by and say hi!</p>

<h2>Latest news</h2>

<p>Recently I had the honor of performing in <a
href="http://www.bangonacan.org/marathon/schedule">Bang on a Can
Marathon</a> in front of an audience of two thousand. My performance of
<a href="http://www.moritzeggert.de/">Moritz Eggert</a>'s
<cite>One Man Band</cite> was mentioned in the <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/arts/music/02bang.html">New York
Times</a>!

<blockquote>Germany had a striking entry as well, in the pianist
Shiau-uen Ding's daredevil account of Moritz Eggert's
<q>H&auml;mmerklavier III: One Man Band,</q> a piece that requires a
pianist to beat on almost every surface of the instrument (sometimes
while playing the keyboard), as well as stamp, sing and hit bass notes
with her left foot.</blockquote>

(Michael Fiday: I read the review...didn't realize Shiau-uen was
German!)</p>
